#hello, mundo

I’m a designer/front end engineer, located in São Paulo Brasil. I love desing and film, and I can’t think of anything else more fun to do for a living. I Have formal education in Design (at UAM of São Paulo – Brasil), Audiovisual (UEM of Madrid – Spain) and a english summer class at the university of Liverpool. I continually motivated to perfect my skills and stay on top of the fast moving web world.
